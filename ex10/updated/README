=============================

= README for ex10: there is 1 program in this file, spilt into 5 files
=
=============================

this ex will play the game Asteroids, using OOP.

this game will consist of a game loop that checks every iteration that certain
action have been taken.

for instance - draw the items in the screen for example, the ship, the
asteroids, the torpedos..

there are also function to handle movement of the object and to update them.

this loop also handles collisions between objects in the game.

question part:
1. we have decided to design this program with inheretance in mind. since we
notinedthat the classes for the different objects are very similar, we 
decided to construct a main class that will be generic with all of the 
function that are shared between the different objects on the screen - 
and so they all inheret whatever they need and customize them in their
own classes.
we could have just made classes for every single object but it would have been incredibly repetitive, and where's the fun in that? :)

2. move_object - a function that handles movement on the screen for a given
object - can dynamically move every object without depending on the type of the
object. this helped us with the design if the code.
we could have made a single function for each movement but it would have been
more wasteful and repetitive.

3.teleportation - uses a helper function - teleportation_location_valid to check
if a location is intersected with an asteroid. it uses as a validation factor
to know if it is possible to teleport to that location- if it is invalid it
continues the loop in teleportation func.
we could have made several complicated nested loops to check is a teleportation
site is valid but it would have been much more complicated to implement and we
decided it would be better to do it in a separated function.
