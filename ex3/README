=
= README for ex3: there are 9 programs in this file.
=
=============================



1. input_list: function witch gets an input of strings and returns a
list of all the strings.

2. concat_list: a function that recieves a list of strings, and returns a
concatenated string of all the strings from the list.

3. maximum: a function that gets a list of numbers, and returns the largest

4.cyclic: gets 2 lists, and checks whether or not they are cyclic versions of
each other. returns true of false.

5. seven_boom: gets a number, and generates a list containig the result of the 
game "seven boom"

6. histogram: gets a number n, and a list of numbers. returns a list containig
their histogram.

7. prime_factors: gets a number, and returns a list with all of the prime
factors of that 
number

8. cartesian: gets 2 lists, and returns a list with their cartesian
multiplication.

9. pairs: gets a list of numbers and a number n. returns a list with all
the pairs summing to the number n.


==================================================================
another file:

check_maximum: tests different values to if the function maximum works
correctly.

the test are:
tests 0:  maximum([1, 2, 3]) == 3  # test a normal input
tests 1:  maximum([-4, 2, 3]) == 3  # test with a negative number
tests 2:  maximum([]) == None # tests an empty list
tests 3:  maximum([4.5, 2, 3]) == 4.5 # test with a float
tests 4:  maximum([3, 3, 3]) == 3  # test when all number in list
are the same
tests 5:  maximum([0, 3, 4]) == 4  # test with a zero in the list

==========================================================

part 5: theoretical questions:
1. it won't run, since the function expects lists type, and it gets integers.
2. returns 0: the program expects a natural number(or 0) and so the default
maximum is set at 0.. non of the values set here are larger than 0.
3. the program will crash since it expects a list with number, and when it
tries to do math operation with a string, it will fail.
4. the program will fail because the length of the list is larger than 
the number given(n). the index will be out of bounds.
5.return an empty list[]- no factos for 0.
6. it will return - [[0, 2], [1, 1]] - the correct answer :)  hopefully?
